# Homework_4_Portfolio_Analysis

In this homework we worked on calling data from different CSV files, combining them into one dataframe. Then arranged the data by date index and organized all the other numerical data to same format to work together. Using this newly made dataframe, we calculated daily returns and other ratios of various stocks.

Once this was done, we called in data for 3 new stocks, combined into a dataframe and calculated the returns. We then added new stock data and now made a new bigger data frame containing all the stocks we worked on. Then we compared the old stocks to the new stocks to see if it would be a wise investement.
